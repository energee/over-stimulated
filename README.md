# OverStimulated

OverStimulated is a macOS utility that simulates natural human cursor movement to keep your computer active. It creates organic, human-like mouse movements with realistic acceleration, deceleration, and pause patterns.

## Features

- üñ±Ô∏è Realistic cursor movement simulation
  - Natural acceleration and deceleration
  - Random direction changes
  - Micro-jitters that mimic human hand tremors
  - Edge-aware behavior that respects screen boundaries
  
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Intelligent pausing system
  - Random pauses that mimic human behavior
  - Smooth slowdown before pausing
  - Manual pause/resume with keyboard shortcut
  
- üéØ Focus point system
  - Simulates human tendency to gravitate toward certain screen areas
  - Dynamically changes over time
  
- üéõÔ∏è Menu bar controls
  - Easy access to pause/resume
  - Quick quit option
  - Keyboard shortcuts (P to pause, Q to quit)

## To Modify

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in Xcode
3. Build and run the application
4. Grant accessibility permissions when prompted

## To install

Available in the builds on the right.

## Usage

Once launched, OverStimulated runs in your menu bar. The icon indicates the current state:
- ‚è∫Ô∏è Circle: Active (cursor moving)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Pause: Paused

### Controls
- Click the menu bar icon to access controls
- Press `p` to toggle pause/resume
- Press `q` to quit the application

## Configuration

The cursor behavior can be fine-tuned by modifying the constants in `CursorConfig.swift`. Key parameters include:

- Base movement speed
- Edge margins
- Pause frequency and duration
- Movement noise and jitter
- Speed variation
- Direction change probability

## Requirements

- macOS 15.1 or later
- Xcode 16.2 or later (for development)

## Privacy

OverStimulated requires accessibility permissions to control the cursor position. It operates entirely locally and does not collect or transmit any data.
